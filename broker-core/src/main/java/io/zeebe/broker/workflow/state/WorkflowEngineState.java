/*
 * Workflow Execution Concept:
 *
 * Processing concept:
 *
 * In: 1 event ---> BPMN step evaluation ---> Out: n events
 *
 * Data structures:
 *
 * - Index
 * - Events in log stream
 *
 * The index always contains the latest, materialized state of a workflow instance.
 * Events on the log stream have two purposes:
 *
 * - They represent changes to that state (=> that can be recorded via exporters)
 * - A state change can trigger other state changes, i.e. the workflow stream processor
 *   reacts to them. This allows us to break complex operations into smaller, atomic steps.
 *
 * In conclusion:
 *
 * - Whenever we process an event or command, we publish their effects as follow-up events.
 *   At the time of publication, the index already contains these effects.
 *
 * Index state:
 *
 * - In the index, we have two things:
 *   - element instances
 *   - tokens
 * - An element instance is an instance of a stateful BPMN element (e.g. service task, subprocess)
 * - A token is any event that is published to get from one element instance to another (e.g. sequence
 *   flow events, gateways). Some of these events are stored in the index for later reference (e.g.
 *   parallel merge), but most are not. There is no concept of token identity.
 * - Element instances are explicitly represented in the index (e.g. to be able to cancel them),
 *   tokens are counted (e.g. if there is still "something" going on, when we would
 *   like to complete a scope).
 * - Both things are transparently maintained in the index whenever an event is consumed or published.
